you are my tutor - i want you to help me prepare for written exam and interview. Make a plan of a set of categories in descending order of priority. Then for each categories, give a quick high level read. after that start asking me evaluation questions - check my answers - if I give wrong answer, correct me with right understanding and if I am right, help me with expanded understanding and when you think I am ready move me towards next section or category. That way nudge me towards better readiness for the JD. feel free to adopt a different strategy for preparation but keep me informed about it. time is less and I want to prepare as fast as possible. So, apply 20-80 rule for readiness.

# Rapid Prep Plan for eBay ML Engineer (Recsys) — 80/20 Focus

Below is a prioritized roadmap, a quick high-level read for each category, and then we’ll start with targeted evaluation questions. We’ll move fast, correct misconceptions immediately, and deepen only where it yields outsized gains for this JD.

## Priority Order (highest to lowest)

1) Production Recommender Systems Design (retrieval → ranking → re-ranking; latency/SLOs; A/B)
2) Deep Learning Retrieval + Vector Search (two-tower, embeddings, ANN)
3) Ranking & Objectives (features, LTR, multi-objective: CTR/CVR/GMV/Ads)
4) Data/Infra & MLOps at Scale (batch + streaming, features, monitoring, rollout)
5) GCP Vertex AI & Vector Search (how to map the system onto GCP)
6) LLMs/RAG for Recommendations (fusion with behavioral models, costs/latency, eval)
7) Big Data + NoSQL/Redis Patterns (Spark/Hadoop, Airflow/Dataflow, cache design)
8) System Metrics, Experimentation & Guardrails (stats rigor, guardrails, failure modes)
9) Behavioral Interview & Story Playbook (impact narratives, tradeoffs, failures)

I’ll start at the top and only drill deeper as needed. If answers are solid, I’ll accelerate to the next section.

## (1) Production Recommender Systems Design — Quick Read
- Goal: deliver relevant candidates fast, then rank precisely under strict latency and availability SLOs.
- Typical flow: logs → offline training (embeddings, rankers) → online retrieval (ANN) → feature assembly (feature store/Redis) → ranking → re-ranking/diversity/business rules → response within p99 budget (e.g., 150–250 ms end-to-end).
- Cold start: popularity/semantic/neighborhood bootstraps, metadata embeddings, seller/item-side priors.
- Real-time signals: recency of user actions, session context, query intent.
- Evaluation: offline (AUC/NDCG/Recall@K), online (A/B with CTR, CVR, GMV, RPM, guardrails: latency, bounce, complaints).
- Reliability: fallbacks if ANN or feature service slows; degrade gracefully.

Evaluation — Section 1
Q1. Outline an e-commerce recommender’s end-to-end serving path from user request to response under a 200 ms p99 budget. Include retrieval source(s), feature assembly, ranking, and fallbacks.

Q2. Name two cold-start tactics for new items and two for new users that don’t rely on historical clicks.

Q3. What offline metrics would you use to validate retrieval and ranking before an A/B? Which online KPIs and guardrails would you track?

Please answer Q1–Q3 succinctly. I’ll review and either correct or extend, then move you forward.
----------------

Here's a breakdown of the key concepts in production recommender system design:

1. System Architecture Flow
Logs → Offline Training: User interaction data is collected and used to train models (e.g., embeddings for items/users, ranking models).
Online Retrieval (ANN): Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search quickly retrieves candidate items from large catalogs (e.g., using FAISS, HNSW).
Feature Assembly: Features (user history, item attributes, context) are fetched from low-latency stores (Redis, feature stores).
Ranking → Re-ranking: Initial ranking by ML models, followed by business rules (diversity, freshness, constraints).
2. Key Components
Latency SLOs: Strict latency targets (e.g., 150–250 ms end-to-end) to ensure real-time responsiveness.
Cold Start: Strategies for new users/items:
Popularity/Semantic Bootstraps: Recommend trending items or use metadata (e.g., item titles/categories).
Neighborhood Methods: Leverage similar users/items (e.g., collaborative filtering).
Real-Time Signals: Incorporate:
Recency: Weight recent user actions (clicks, searches) more heavily.
Session Context: Current user activity (e.g., browsing category).
Query Intent: Search terms or inferred goals.
3. Evaluation
Offline Metrics:
AUC/NDCG: Measure ranking quality (AUC for binary relevance, NDCG for graded relevance).
Recall@K: Percentage of relevant items retrieved in top-K candidates.
Online Metrics (A/B Tests):
CTR/CVR: Click-through and conversion rates.
GMV/RPM: Gross merchandise volume/revenue per mille (business impact).
Guardrails: Monitor latency, bounce rates, and user complaints.
4. Reliability
Fallbacks: If ANN/feature services slow down, use:
Cached results: Stale but fast recommendations.
Simpler models: Rule-based fallbacks (e.g., "popular near you").
Graceful Degradation: Maintain service quality even during partial failures.
5. **Example Workflow
User Searches "Running Shoes":

ANN retrieves 1,000 shoe candidates.
Feature store fetches user preferences (e.g., brand affinity, size).
Ranker scores candidates (e.g., using a DNN).
Re-ranker applies diversity (mix of brands/price ranges).
Top 10 results returned in <200 ms.
New User Joins:

Cold-start: Recommend popular running shoes + items based on signup metadata (location, age).
Tools/Technologies
ANN: FAISS, HNSW, ScaNN.
Feature Stores: Feast, Tecton, Redis.
Ranking: TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost.
Monitoring: Prometheus (latency), Kibana (logs).
Key Trade-offs
Latency vs. Recall: More candidates → better recall but slower.
Freshness vs. Stability: Real-time signals improve relevance but may increase variance.
This design balances speed, relevance, and reliability while allowing iterative improvement through offline/online evaluation.

## (2) Deep Learning Retrieval + Vector Search — Quick Read
- Two-tower: user tower (behavioral sequence, demographics, context) and item tower (text/title, category, image, price). Train with contrastive losses (in-batch negatives, sampled softmax).
- Embedding maintenance: frequent retrain; user embeddings may be real-time (session-based) or last-N actions; item embeddings updated on content changes.
- ANN: HNSW/ScaNN/IVF-PQ; balance recall vs. latency; shard/partition by category or popularity; cache hot queries.
- Blending: combine behavioral candidates (co-view/co-buy) with semantic/vector retrieval; dedup and prioritize.

Evaluation — Section 2 (we’ll go here after Section 1)
- Define training objective and negative sampling for a two-tower.
- Tradeoffs between HNSW and IVF-PQ.
- How to keep user embeddings fresh within 10–50 ms budget.

----------------------------
Here's a breakdown of the key concepts in the document about Deep Learning Retrieval + Vector Search:

1. Two-Tower Model Architecture
User Tower
Inputs:
Behavioral Sequence: Past clicks, purchases, searches.
Demographics: Age, gender, location.
Context: Time of day, device, session activity.
Output: A dense vector (embedding) representing the user’s current interests.
Item Tower
Inputs:
Text/Title: Product descriptions, titles.
Category: Product taxonomy (e.g., "Electronics > Phones").
Image: Visual features (using CNNs or ViTs).
Price: Scalar value (normalized).
Output: A dense vector representing the item’s features.
Training
Contrastive Losses:
In-Batch Negatives: Treat other items in the same batch as negatives for a given user-item pair.
Sampled Softmax: Efficiently sample negatives from the full item catalog.
Goal: Ensure user and item embeddings are close in vector space if they are relevant (e.g., user clicked the item).
2. Embedding Maintenance
User Embeddings
Real-Time (Session-Based): Update embeddings during a session (e.g., using RNNs/Transformers).
Last-N Actions: Aggregate recent interactions (e.g., average of last 10 clicks).
Challenge: Balance freshness (real-time updates) vs. stability (avoid noisy signals).
Item Embeddings
Update Triggers:
Content changes (e.g., price drop, new description).
Periodic retraining (e.g., daily/weekly).
Cold Start: Use metadata (title, category) for new items before enough interactions exist.
3. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search
Algorithms
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): Fast and high recall, but higher memory usage.
ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): Optimized for GPU, good recall-latency trade-off.
IVF-PQ (Inverted File with Product Quantization): Memory-efficient, partitions data into clusters.
Optimizations
Recall vs. Latency: More candidates → higher recall but slower retrieval.
Sharding/Partitioning:
By category (e.g., separate indices for "Electronics" and "Clothing").
By popularity (e.g., hot items in a fast cache).
Caching: Store results for frequent queries (e.g., "iPhone 15").
4. Blending Retrieval Strategies
Candidate Sources
Behavioral Retrieval:
Co-View/Co-Buy: "Users who viewed X also viewed Y."
Collaborative Filtering: User-item interaction matrices.
Semantic/Vector Retrieval: ANN search over embeddings.
Post-Processing
Deduplication: Remove near-identical items (e.g., same product in different colors).
Prioritization:
Business rules (e.g., boost high-margin items).
Diversity (e.g., mix categories, price ranges).
Key Trade-offs
Aspect	Option A	Option B
Freshness	Real-time user embeddings	Periodic updates
Recall	More ANN candidates	Fewer candidates
Latency	Faster (cached/popular)	Slower (full ANN)
Cold Start	Metadata-based	Hybrid (metadata + similarity)
Example Workflow
User Searches "Running Shoes":

User tower generates embedding from query + context.
ANN retrieves 1,000 shoe candidates.
Blending:
600 from vector search (semantic matches).
300 from co-view (behavioral).
100 from popularity fallback.
Dedup and re-rank (e.g., diversity, price).
New Item "Yoga Mat":

Item tower uses title/category to create embedding.
Initially shown via metadata similarity until interactions accumulate.
Tools/Libraries
Embedding Training: TensorFlow/PyTorch (two-tower), HuggingFace (text).
ANN: FAISS, ScaNN, HNSWLib.
Real-Time: Redis (caching), Apache Kafka (streaming).
This approach balances accuracy (via deep learning) and scalability (via ANN/search optimizations).

## (3) Ranking & Objectives — Quick Read
- Ranker options: GBDT/LTR for speed, DNN/transformers for richer interactions; often hybrid.
- Objectives: multi-task or multi-objective (CTR, CVR/GMV, Ads revenue, satisfaction signals).
- Bias handling: position bias, exposure bias; calibration; counterfactual correction.
- Constraints: diversity, novelty, seller fairness, ads blending.

Evaluation — Section 3
- Design a feature set for ranker; handle leakage, freshness.
- Combine CTR and GMV into a single objective; control for ads.

-----------------------------
Here's a detailed breakdown of the key concepts in ranking systems for recommendation engines:

1. Ranker Options
GBDT/LTR (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees/Learning to Rank)
Speed: Extremely fast inference (microseconds per prediction)
Features: Handles structured features well (user history, item metadata)
Implementation: Uses LambdaMART or pairwise ranking objectives
Best for: First-stage ranking with thousands of candidates
DNN/Transformers
Rich Interactions: Models complex user-item relationships via attention
Features: Handles unstructured data (text, images, sequences)
Implementation: Two-tower architectures or cross-attention models
Best for: Final ranking with hundreds of candidates
Hybrid Approach
python


# Example hybrid ranking pipeline
def rank_items(user, candidates):
    # First stage: GBDT for fast filtering
    gbdt_scores = gbdt_model.predict(user, candidates[:5000])
    top_500 = sorted(zip(candidates, gbdt_scores), key=lambda x: -x[1])[:500]

    # Second stage: DNN for precise ranking
    dnn_inputs = prepare_cross_features(user, [c[0] for c in top_500])
    dnn_scores = dnn_model.predict(dnn_inputs)

    # Combine scores
    final_scores = [0.7*dnn + 0.3*gbdt for dnn, (_, gbdt) in zip(dnn_scores, top_500)]
    return sorted(zip([c[0] for c in top_500], final_scores), key=lambda x: -x[1])
2. Multi-Objective Optimization
Objective	Metric	Implementation
CTR	Click-through rate	Binary cross-entropy
CVR	Conversion rate	Two-tower with purchase signal
GMV	Gross merchandise value	Regression on order value
Satisfaction	Long-term engagement	Reward modeling with RL
Multi-Task Learning Example:

python


class MultiTaskHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.ctr_head = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        self.cvr_head = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.ctr_head(x)), torch.sigmoid(self.cvr_head(x))
3. Bias Handling Techniques
Position Bias
Problem: Items in top positions get more clicks regardless of relevance
Solution:
python


# Inverse propensity weighting
def debias_clicks(clicks, position_probs):
    return clicks / position_probs
Exposure Bias
Problem: Users only see a limited subset of items
Solution:
Explore-exploit strategies (ε-greedy, Thompson sampling)
Bandit algorithms for online correction
4. Constraint Implementation
Diversity Enforcement
python


def diversify(results, category_map, max_per_cat=2):
    diversified = []
    cat_counts = defaultdict(int)

    for item, score in results:
        cat = category_map[item]
        if cat_counts[cat] < max_per_cat:
            diversified.append(item)
            cat_counts[cat] += 1
        if len(diversified) >= 10:
            break
    return diversified
Fairness Constraints
Seller Fairness:
python


def enforce_fairness(scores, seller_ids, alpha=0.3):
    seller_scores = aggregate_by_seller(scores, seller_ids)
    adjusted = [s * (1 + alpha*(1 - seller_scores[sid]))
               for s, sid in zip(scores, seller_ids)]
    return adjusted
Key Trade-offs
Aspect	Option A	Option B
Accuracy	Complex DNN	Simple GBDT
Latency	100ms	5ms
Freshness	Near-real-time	Daily updates
Fairness	Strict constraints	Optimized engagement
Practical Implementation Flow
Candidate Generation: Retrieve 10K items via vector search
First-Stage Rank: GBDT reduces to 500 candidates (μs latency)
Second-Stage Rank: DNN scores with cross-features (ms latency)
Constraint Application: Enforce diversity/fairness rules
Online Learning: Update models with real-time signals
This architecture balances accuracy, latency, and business requirements while handling the complexities of modern recommendation systems.
