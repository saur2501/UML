        Part - Cloud Platform (VNF)
            Narrative - Our Part under Vivek Soni resp handles cloud for VNF
                SDN -
                    Control Layer centralized and Data Layer distributed across devices.
                    Software Defined Network with CNLB.
                        How - Centralized control plane and individual many data planes so where CNLB would fit - think innovative.
                        Policies for CNLB operating at data plane can come from SDN sitting in control plane - sounds good.
                        This means at present we have centralized system which can push configs and commands for individual devices or apps.
                            Imagine, SDN pushing configs and shell files from SDN system on cloud - one command defining what the whole system should do - like updates, policies, etc.
                    Central control for all devices based on commands (Transactional part).
                        On-boarding devices with zero touch.
                SCO - Samsung Cloud Orchestrator (FND Part)
                    Centralized dashboard view of all cluster view across SRIB including CNLB.
                        Tools like prometheus or REST APIs or direct Helm used to get status across all the clusters.
                        Control lifecycle and overview of many clusters from a web interface (may seem like a website).
                    Centralized monitoring and controlling all Cloud installations
                        like CNLB installation from there.

            Telecom
                Data Plane - Actual work of moving data.
                    It's the do part like worker bee.
                    Like mailman who just rides on the road he is told.
                    RAN DU - Distributed Unit - handles actual transmission of data - like the hands to move data.
                    RAN UP - User plane - where the data traffic flows like highway.
                Control Plane - decisions about how data should move.
                    manager who makes decisions - like which streets mail carrier should take.
                    RAN Control Unit - control the network and makes decisions about data like the brain.
                    Involves Comprehensive decision making - so cnlb, sdn are more basic forms of it (with SCO as its management dashboard) - not detailed routing.
                Management Plane - sets rules for control and data planes to work.
                    Ensure smooth operation thru control and maintenance (different from data layers).
                        Brain or control center of the telecom - think of it as "plan" part - boss to ensure eth runs smooth.
                    FCAPS - Fault Configuration Analytics Performance Security
                        Fault - Wire cut, server crash - detective finds out and fix it fast for no interruption.
                        Config - Remote control the telecom (network setup, which signals go where and how strong).
                        Analytics - Monitoring like a lifeguard.
                        Performance - how well it's performing like bike speed - data speed, clarity of phone calls, delays.
                        Security - Only authorized should get access.
            SRINA - revisited arch understanding.
                <DCM>
                eNB to DCM to stitch.
                    Stitched data with stats and alarms shown on dashboard now at OSS level but not original usecase.
                        OSS (operations support systems) is a collection of hardware and software tools
                            designed to help organisations monitor, analyse and manage telecom networks.
                        st used mistaken with LSM or EMS
                            EMS used for FCAPS (fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security) - these were my inputs for research.
                            NMS = EMS + link/connectivity management of all devices+ FCAPS on network basis.
                            Eg - An EMS would be able to give individual alarms on nodes.
                                But NMS can correlate the alarms on different nodes;
                                it can, thus find out root cause alarms when a service is disrupted.
                        OSS (Operation Support Systems) takes a step further - managing multiple vendors across networks.
                        OSS will interact with individual NMSs and provide one dashboard for FCAPS management.
                    Original was DCM stitched data and LSM data taken by SON to find changes in throughput, etc
                        and again informing LSM so that decision of the antenna tilt.
                        Such a cool feature which they should have taken.
                    Input Outputs
                        Input sources - ports protocols, files, zookeeper (if different system for distribution of load), etc
                        Flume Framework inside
                        kafka output, file output, summary and alarms output.
                    I got a feel for it by working on all the tools
                        and making even my own scripts in python, java etc to parse, extract, stitch,
                        and combine over flume arch of hybrid packets.
                        eNB, gNB, MME, etc send these "analytical information" packets already for further insights.
                </DCM>

                DMA (Data Monitoring Analyzer) product was used to take data from LSM
                    and utilize that for sth like for SON maybe.

                    Data Layer teams spread across floors.

                <Platforms>
                    Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are virtualized network services running on open computing platforms
                        formerly carried out by proprietary, dedicated hardware technology.
                        Common VNFs include virtualized routers, firewalls, WAN optimization, and network address translation (NAT) services.
                        CNF is taking these to Cloud - Functionality VMs (?microservices done by VNF) moved to cloud.
                        Our teams plan was 3 microservices like computation microservice, writing microservice, etc which was a bad idea.
                    Cloud Platform - all of the CNF => k8s obviously.
                        SCO (aka CMS) - facade over all such systems.
                        CNLB - the real deal to load-balance and forward packets to all the network servers made from hitherto hardware deployed servers.
                        ?SDN - control layer consolidation in telecom network.

                Management tricks - give work to multiple vendors across geography.

                    take the best among the 2.

            SRINA - Relp - Full circle Nagendra timelines discussion
                Nagendra full circle discussion where we also discussed before pandemic
                    but after with different people - praised by previous colleagues.
                Varada managing both EMS and Analytics 2014
                    when samsung network significantly grew as tie up between jio and samsung for win win.
                    Although small presence since 1990s.
                    too much work so recruited Nagendra
                    Handed over for analytics 2017 to 21 till June
                    but Varada later wanted to work more on research so swapped with Nagendra for Analytics.
                Analytics team shrunk from 45 members 4 teams to 1.1 teams with 10 members
                    GT promoted by Nagendra to handle DCM and VoMA and sleepless nights to manage so needed help also.
                    This means Varada had too much responsibilities
                    and your responsibilities can always be scaled as per your situation if it gets too demanding
                    but you always choose to work on a lot.
                POC for SON to make antenna tilt but significantly
                    samsung keeps trying that - finally they said that they were already using 7 else
                    although even their own teams were helping to build it.
                But position of advantage that many other telecom providers used our developed product.
                So the larger ecosystem of networking in samsung under Amit Mannan became clear
                    We are managing all layers - data layers, control layers (MME not much though), analytical or mgmt layers (very prominently).
